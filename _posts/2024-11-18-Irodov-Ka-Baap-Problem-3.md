# IKB - Subset Sum

# Problem
You are given two integer arrays $$A$$ and $$B$$, such that $$|A| = n$$ and $$|B| = m$$. Further all elements of $$A$$ are in the range $$\[1, \cdots, m \]$$ and all elements of $$B$$ are in the range $$\[1, \cdots, n\]$$.

Prove that there exist non-empty subarrays of A and B that have the same sum.
