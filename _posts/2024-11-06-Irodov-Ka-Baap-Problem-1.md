# Irodov Ka Baap - Origins

I have been interested in solving, creating and curating math puzzles since high school. This tendency has helped me crack competitive exams, clear job interviews and make friends with loads of interesting people. As a high schooler, I had dreamt of writing a book with all my favourite puzzles in it, and calling it Irodov Ka Baap. 

For readers who don't know, Problems in General Physics by I.E. Irodov was a book full of cool phsyics puzzles that nerdy Indian teenagers venerated, feared and adored. In Hindi, the phrase "X ka baap" literally means X's father, and colloquially is used to denote something far superior to X. Hence the title "Irodov Ka Baap" was my way of claiming that my (yet to be written) book was far superior to a book beloved by the most brilliant minds in my country. To answer your question, yes, 18 year old me was an insufferable prick with delusions of grandeur. (Also, a small fraction of you reading this are probably saying "BTW Irodov ka baap already exists, it's called Aptitude Test Problems in Physics by SS Krotov". Hey, good for you buddy! You're probably going to die alone, but at least you know about Krotov!)

I actually took IKB further along than most of my projects (I even managed to sell an early draft for Rs. 50k!) but eventually it floundered. The act of writing my thoughts down in a comprehensible way proved to be surprisingly hard. As time went on, my core interest in puzzle-solving was dying. My puzzle friends started re-directing their mental bandwidth towards excelling in their careers, or having babies or going insane. My own mental bandwidth proved insufficient for such lofty goals, and was exhausted in trying to unentangle the tedious, bureaucratic mazes adults are required to run through.

Recently however, life came full circle for me. In the course of helping some high schoolers prepare for the AMC, I revisited the old neural pathways and rediscovered the dormant joy of puzzle solving. I decided to make use of this momentum to write down some of my favourite puzzles for the internet audience. The hope is to post a new puzzle each day for as long as I can. 

The solution for the previous days puzzle will be posted alongwith the puzzle for the next day. 

Warning: Solutions may include long winded philosphical ramblings from me on how I came up with them. 

So without further ado, lets kick off what is hopefully a long and fruitful series of blogposts. 

# Puzzle 1:

Two infinitely intelligent and truthful mathematicians P and Q meet to play a game. Each of them individually decides on a secret real number greater than 1. (P's number is p and Q's number is q) They submit their numbers to a moderator M, who reveals to both of them the product pq, along with another number r. M doesn't reveal which number is pq and which number is r. This entire setup is common knowledge between P and Q, i.e. they both know the setup and know that the other knows the setup etc. 

M then turns to P and asks him if he knows q. If P says no, he asks Q if he knows p. If Q says no, he then asks P again, and so on. Prove that this game terminates after a finite number of rounds.
