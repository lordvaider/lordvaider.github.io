# IKB - The Impossible Problem Version 1729.0

# Puzzle 1:

Two infinitely intelligent and truthful mathematicians P and Q meet to play a game. Each of them individually decides on a secret real number greater than 1. (P's number is p and Q's number is q) They submit their numbers to a moderator M, who reveals to both of them the product pq, along with another number r. M doesn't reveal which number is pq and which number is r. This entire setup is common knowledge between P and Q, i.e. they both know the setup and know that the other knows the setup etc. 

M then turns to P and asks him if he knows q. If P says no, he asks Q if he knows p. If Q says no, he then asks P again, and so on. Prove that this game terminates after a finite number of rounds.
