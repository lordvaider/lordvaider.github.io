# IKB - Span of a Tetrahedron

For a set $$E$$ in $$R^3$$, let $$L(E)$$ consist of all points on all lines determined by any two points of $$E$$. Thus if $$V$$ consists of the four vertices of a regular tetrahedron, then $$L(V)$$ consists of the six edges of the tetrahedron, extended infinitely in both directions. Does $$L(L(V))$$ span all of $$R^3$$?
